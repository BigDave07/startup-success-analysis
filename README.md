# 🚀 Startup Success & Failure Analysis (Crunchbase Dataset)

This project explores a dataset of over **66,000 startups** sourced from Crunchbase, using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to uncover trends and patterns behind startup success or failure.

🔍 We examine variables such as:
- Funding amounts
- Startup outcomes (operating, closed, IPO, acquired)
- Founding years
- Industry categories
- Lifespan and milestones
- Geographical location

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **IPO startups** tend to raise significantly higher funding than operating or closed ones.
- The **U.S. dominates** the global startup landscape.
- The **startup boom peaked between 2005–2015**, aligning with global tech growth.
- **Operating startups** tend to live longer and raise more funding.
- Certain **industries show higher survival rates** than others.
