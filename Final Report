 Exploratory Data Analysis on Startup Success and Failure
 Course: Applied Data Science Capstone (Coursera)
Learner: David Oladipupo
Dataset: Big Startup Success/Failure Dataset from Crunchbase

 1. Dataset Summary
This dataset, sourced from Crunchbase, contains detailed information on over 66,000 startups, including both
successful and failed ventures. Each row represents a startup, with columns capturing attributes such as
funding, founding date, industry, employee size, and outcome.
Key Columns:
- name: Startup name
- status: Outcome (operating, closed, acquired, or ipo)
- category_list: Industry sector(s)
- country_code, state_code: Location
- funding_total_usd: Total funding in USD
- founded_at, last_funding_at: Key dates
- employee_range: Size of the workforce
- funding_rounds, milestones: Activity and achievements

 2. Data Exploration Plan
The main objective is to uncover the key factors influencing startup success or failure.
We aimed to answer:
- Are successful startups better funded?
- Does the founding year affect survival?
- Do certain industries or countries produce more resilient startups?
Steps:
1. Clean and summarize data
 Exploratory Data Analysis on Startup Success and Failure
2. Visualize distributions
3. Engineer new features
4. Form hypotheses and test

 3. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Cleaning:
- Converted funding_total_usd and dates to appropriate formats
- Handled missing values (NaN for missing funding; no closed_at column present)
Feature Engineering:
- founded_year: Extracted from founded_at
- lifespan_years: Difference between last_funding_at and founded_at
- is_operating: Binary flag (1 if operating, 0 if closed/other)

 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Startup Outcome Distribution
Most startups are still operating, but a significant number have closed.
Funding vs Status
- IPO startups are significantly better funded
- Some failed startups raised large funds, but generally higher funding boosts survival odds
Country-wise Startup Distribution
- USA dominates startup scene
- Other countries show higher failure percentages
Founding Year Trends
- Peak between 20052015 (global tech boom)
- Startups after 2015 show less survival (may reflect incomplete data)

 5. Hypothesis Testing
H1: Funding Impacts Success
- H0: No difference in funding between closed and operating startups
- Result: P-value < 0.0001 Reject H0
H2: Lifespan and Outcome
- H0: Failed and operating startups have same average lifespan
- Result: P-value < 0.001 Reject H0
H3: Industry Influences Outcome
- H0: Industry and outcome are independent
- Result: P-value < 0.001 Reject H0

 6. Key Findings & Insights
- High funding and longer lifespan are strong predictors of startup survival
- Industry and geography play a role
- Most startups were founded during tech boom years
- Startups in the US have higher survival rates

 Conclusion
This EDA has uncovered clear patterns explaining startup outcomes. It demonstrates core data science skills:
data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and hypothesis testingvaluable for real-world business
applications.
